# Getting Started with the Drivers Hub

Welcome to the getting started guide for the drivers hub. This guide will walk you through the process of setting up the drivers hub for your VTC. If you have any questions, feel free to join our [discord](https://discord.gg/gaVS7scSD2) and ask in the support channel or create a ticket. Now, this guide will be split into two sections, one for the VTC owner and one for the drivers. If you are a driver, please skip to the [drivers section](#drivers). If you are a VTC owner, please continue reading.

## Prerequisites

Before you can get started with the drivers hub, you will need to have a few things ready. These are:

1. Creating an account on the drivers hub [here](https://drivershub.charlws.com/)
2. (Optional) Having a [tracksim](https://tracksim.app/) account to track jobs and mileage automagicly


If you have all of these things, you are ready to get started with the drivers hub. If you are missing any of these things, please go and get them before continuing;
as the rest of this guide will not work without them.
